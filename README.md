# 🌿 Air Quality Prediction

This project is an **Air Quality Prediction** application built with **Machine Learning** and **Django**. It uses a **Random Forest** model to predict air quality based on various environmental factors.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview
Air quality is a crucial aspect of public health, and **predicting air quality** in real-time can help mitigate health risks. This web application allows users to input environmental data and receive a **prediction** of the air quality index (AQI), helping raise awareness and promote cleaner environments.

## 🎯 Features
- 🔍 **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes **Random Forest** for accurate air quality prediction.
- 🌐 **Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly, interactive interface built with **Django**.
- 🌡️ **Real-time Data**: Predicts air quality based on real-time environmental data inputs.
- 📊 **Data Visualizations**: Displays air quality trends and predictions using beautiful charts.
